# Parking Frenzy (Prototype)

**Parking Frenzy** is a 3D Unity prototype where the player drives a car and parks it in designated spots to complete the level. The challenge is to park without hitting obstacles like footpaths or other cars.

## Gameplay

- **Objective:** Park your car in all the marked spots without crashing.
- **Mechanics:**
  - There are three parking spots on the map.
  - Each parking spot is marked with a balloon above it.
  - When you park in the current spot, the balloon disappears and the next one appears over the next spot.
  - Colliding with a footpath or parked cars results in **Game Over**.
  - Successfully parking in all three spots wins the game.
